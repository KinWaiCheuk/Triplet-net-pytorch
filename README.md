# PyTorch Triplet Loss and Online Mining
Implementation of triplet loss, and online mining on Pytorch

This code is a PyTorch implementation of Olivier Moindrot's blog post https://omoindrot.github.io/triplet-loss and his github repository https://github.com/omoindrot/tensorflow-triplet-loss, who implement the triplet loss and online mining on Tensorflow.

My repository aims at implementing triplet loss with minimal amount of codes.

# Triplet-net-pytorch
Implementation of triplet loss, and online mining on Pytorch

This code is the a PyTorch implementation for Olivier Moindrot's blog post https://omoindrot.github.io/triplet-loss and his github repository https://github.com/omoindrot/tensorflow-triplet-loss, who implement the Triplet Neural Network with online mining on Tensorflow.

My repository aims at implementing triplet loss with minimal amount of codes.
See my Keras version here https://github.com/KinWaiCheuk/Triplet-net-keras (offline mining version)
